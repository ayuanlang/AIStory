    "User Request Analysis:\n",
    "1. Ensure \"Scene\" export/storage only contains the 8 defined columns + Project/Episode Context.\n",
    "   - I have already modified `SceneManager.handleSave` to add context info and only export the 8 columns.\n",
    "   - The user also wants to \"remove the extra fields\" from the Scene table. The `handleSave` logic I wrote reconstructs the table from `scenes` data, so it effectively drops any extra columns that were in a previous string.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. \"Add project information\"\n",
    "   - Added `Project: ... | Episode: ...` line to Scene export.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. \"Shots table same logic\"\n",
    "   - I need to implement a `handleSave` for `ShotsView` (or update logic) that saves a standardized table to `shot_content`.\n",
    "   - Currently `ShotsView` seems to primarily work with the DB (`createShot`, `updateShot`). It doesn't seem to have a \"Save to Text/Markdown\" button like SceneManager does.\n",
    "   - But wait, `SceneManager` also updates DB *and* saves detailed text to `scene_content`.\n",
    "   - `ShotsView` has `handleImport` but I need to find where it saves `shot_content` or if it should.\n",
    "   - The user implies they want to be able to \"import/export\" or \"display\" it in a specific way.\n",
    "   - If `ShotsView` does not have a \"Save\" button, I should add one similar to `SceneManager` that exports the shots to Markdown and saves it to `activeEpisode.shot_content`.\n",
    "   - Then `ShotsView` import should handle this format.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look for where `shot_content` is used.\n",
    "It is pushed to `handleSyncScenes` but not seemingly written to by `ShotsView` except maybe in an unimplemented `handleSave`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Plan:\n",
    "1.  Add `handleSave` to `ShotsView` that generates the \"Strict Table\" + Context.\n",
    "2.  Add a \"Save / Export\" button to `ShotsView` UI if missing.\n",
    "3.  Ensure `handleImport` in `ShotsView` aligns with this strict table.\n",
    "\n",
    "Strict Table Columns for Shots?\n",
    "User said \"Shots table same logic\".\n",
    "Current Import cols: `Shot No | Title | Start Frame | End Frame | Video Content | Duration | Entities`.\n",
    "Wait, looking at `handleImport` in `ShotsView`:\n",
    "`shot_number`, `title`, `camera_position` (Start Frame), `camera_movement` (End Frame), `action/description` (Video Content), `duration`, `associated_entities`.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the columns should be:\n",
    "| Shot No | Title | Start Frame | End Frame | Video Content | Duration | Associated Entities |\n",
    "\n",
    "Plus the context header.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
